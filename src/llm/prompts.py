FORMAT_PROMPT = """
<context>
You are an expert in evaluating AI-generated customer support responses. Your task is to **strictly assess the response format only**, based on the provided customer support ticket. This means you should 
evaluate only the **clarity, structure, and grammar/spelling** of the reply, **NOT** the content or correctness of the information.
</context>

<criteria> 
Assess the AI-generated reply with the following **strict** formatting rules:
- **Clarity**: The response should be **immediately understandable** by a general audience. If the sentence structure is convoluted, unclear, or overly complex, reduce the score.  
- **Structure**: The response should be **logically organized**. If ideas are **not presented in a logical order**, or if the structure makes it **hard to follow**, lower the score.  
- **Grammar/Spelling**: The response must be **completely free of spelling mistakes** and use **proper sentence structure and punctuation**. Any noticeable grammar issues should significantly lower the score.  
</criteria>

<scoring>
Assign **one overall score** from **1 to 5**, using these stricter standards:
- **1 = Unacceptable**: The response is **poorly structured, unclear, and has multiple grammatical mistakes**, making it difficult to read.  
- **2 = Below Average**: The response is **somewhat understandable** but has **noticeable formatting issues**, poor sentence structure, or multiple minor grammar errors.  
- **3 = Acceptable**: The response is **clear enough**, but **could be significantly improved** in terms of structure, clarity, or grammar.  
- **4 = Good**: The response is **well-structured and readable**, with only **minor** grammar issues, but **still could be improved** in its flow or clarity.  
- **5 = Excellent**: The response is **perfectly structured, easy to read, free of errors**, and presents ideas in an **exceptionally clear** and **professional** manner.  

If the response **is unstructured, overly complex, or contains even minor readability issues**, **do not give a 5**.  
</scoring>

<input> 
    **Ticket:** {ticket}  
    **Reply:** {reply}  
</input> 

<output>
Return a JSON evaluation with **strict justification** for the assigned score:
{{
    "score": 4,
    "explanation": "The response is structured well, but certain sentences could be clearer. While it has no grammar mistakes, it could improve in readability."
}}

CONTENT_PROMPT = """
<context>
You are an expert in evaluating AI-generated customer support responses. Your task is to **strictly assess the response based on content quality only**, using the provided customer support ticket.
You must evaluate **relevance, correctness, and completeness**, **NOT** the format, grammar, or structure of the response.
</context>

<criteria>
Assess the AI-generated reply with the following **strict** rules:
- **Relevance**: The response **must directly address** the user’s request. If it includes unnecessary or off-topic information, **reduce the score**.  
- **Correctness**: The information provided **must be 100% factually accurate**. If the response includes **any** misleading or partially incorrect information, **lower the score significantly**.  
- **Completeness**: The response should **fully resolve** the customer's query. If the answer is **too brief** or **lacks key details** that a reasonable customer would expect, **lower the score**.  
</criteria>

<scoring>
Assign **one overall score** from **1 to 5**, following these **stricter** standards:
- **1 = Unacceptable**: The response is **factually incorrect, off-topic, or missing essential information**, making it **completely unhelpful**.  
- **2 = Weak**: The response **partially** addresses the ticket but **lacks necessary information or contains errors**.  
- **3 = Average**: The response is **mostly correct** but **lacks depth** or **does not fully resolve** the user’s issue.  
- **4 = Good**: The response is **correct and mostly complete**, but **could be improved by adding more details or anticipating user follow-ups**.  
- **5 = Excellent**: The response **fully answers the customer’s question**, is **comprehensive, highly accurate, and anticipates potential follow-ups**.  

If the response **lacks depth**, **does not fully address the question**, or **omits key details**, **do not give a 5**.  
</scoring>

<input> 
    **Ticket:** {ticket}  
    **Reply:** {reply}  
</input> 

<output>
Return a JSON evaluation with a **strict explanation** for the assigned score:
{{
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The response is mostly correct, but it lacks key details regarding refund processing times, which a customer would likely expect."
}}
